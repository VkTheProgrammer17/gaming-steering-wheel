# gaming-steering-wheel
Simplifying on how to make a DIY gaming steering wheel using Arduino Mega.
Working on the project.
Experimenting.....
Just got to know after my experiments that you cannot make the steering wheel with Arduino Mega unless you install the Atmel Flip driver which automatically uninstall the original Arduino driver. Then I uninstalled the Atmel driver as my code was not geeting uploaded and now it is detecting my Mega as an "Unknown device-driver unavailable". I am going to need Arduino Leonardo.This is why i did not upload any diagrams or source code befor Experimenting. You simply cannot turn turn a Mega to a HID device(aka Input devices like a keyboard)
